## 4. Role Play: Sprint Planning Meeting

### Teacher:

Fikret, today we are planning the tasks for the next sprint. Could you explain how you would estimate the tasks and prioritize them?

### You:

Sure! First, I review the backlog and discuss with the team to understand task complexity. We assign story points based on effort and risks. Tasks with higher priority and lower effort usually get scheduled first to maintain velocity.

### Teacher:

How do you handle deadlines and milestones?

### You:

We set deadlines according to sprint length, usually two weeks. Milestones mark major achievements, like completing the UI or backend integration, helping us track progress.

### Teacher:

What about risks and resource allocation?

### You:

We perform risk assessment to identify potential issues early. For resource allocation, I make sure developers are not overloaded and assign tasks based on expertise.

### Teacher:

Excellent! How do you update the team about changes during the sprint?

### You:

We use daily stand-ups and update our project management tools to reflect any changes in estimation, deadlines, or blockers.
