# Detailed Stand-up Meeting Role Play

### Setting:

You (Fikret) are a software engineer giving your daily update in an Agile team stand-up meeting. I (teacher) am the scrum master asking questions and guiding the meeting.

---

### Teacher (Scrum Master):

Good morning, Fikret! Let’s start with your update. What are you working on today?

### You (Fikret):

Good morning! Today, I am working on integrating the payment gateway API. I have completed the UI part last week, so now I’m focusing on backend integration.

### Teacher:

Great! Any blockers or impediments so far?

### You:

Yes, I am currently blocked by an issue with the authentication service. It seems there is a dependency on the security team to provide the access tokens, and we’re waiting on them.

### Teacher:

Thanks for highlighting that. Have you escalated this issue to the security team or your manager?

### You:

Yes, I escalated the blocker yesterday to the team lead, and I’m following up daily to get an update. Hopefully, it will be resolved soon so we can stay on track.

### Teacher:

Good to hear you are managing the blocker actively. What is your expected deliverable date for this integration?

### You:

I expect to finish the integration by the end of this sprint, which is next Friday. After that, I will start writing tests.

### Teacher:

Sounds good. Are there any risks we should mitigate related to this task?

### You:

One risk is the delay in receiving credentials from the security team, which could cause scope creep if it takes too long. To mitigate this, I’m preparing fallback code that can simulate the authentication until the real tokens arrive.

### Teacher:

Excellent risk mitigation plan! Is there anything else you need help with?

### You:

At the moment, no. But I might need some help from the QA team once the integration is ready for testing.

### Teacher:

Noted. We will coordinate with QA later this week. Lastly, is your work aligned with the overall roadmap and sprint goals?

### You:

Yes, my tasks are fully aligned. I had a quick sync with the product owner yesterday to ensure alignment on priorities.

### Teacher:

Perfect. Thanks for the detailed update, Fikret. Keep up the good work!
