## 4. Role Play: Detailed Stand-up & Retrospective with Escalation

### Part A: Daily Stand-up

**Teacher:**
Good morning, Fikret! Please give your update and let us know if there are any blockers or impediments.

**You:**
Good morning! I’m currently working on the API integration tasks from the sprint backlog. I encountered a blocker related to data synchronization between services, which is delaying my progress.

**Teacher:**
Have you escalated this blocker to the relevant teams? How is cross-team collaboration going?

**You:**
Yes, I escalated it to the backend team yesterday. We had a joint meeting this morning to improve collaboration, and we agreed on an action plan.

**Teacher:**
Great! Are we maintaining our daily cadence for updates? How is the impediment resolution progressing?

**You:**
Yes, the team follows the daily cadence strictly. The impediment tracker was updated this morning, and the backend team is actively working on the fix.

**Teacher:**
Excellent. How do you assess the release readiness with these issues?

**You:**
Release readiness is still on track, but we need to monitor the blocker resolution closely to avoid delays.

### Part B: Sprint Retrospective

**Teacher:**
Now, let’s discuss the sprint retrospective. What went well and what can we improve?

**You:**
The sprint backlog was well defined, and daily stand-ups helped maintain communication. However, the data sync blocker caused some delays. For continuous improvement, we should enhance scope refinement and have more frequent cross-team syncs.

**Teacher:**
Good points. How can we make sure impediments are tracked and resolved faster?

**You:**
We could assign clear impediment owners for each blocker and update the impediment tracker in real time.

**Teacher:**
Excellent suggestion. Thanks, Fikret!
