### Part A: Daily Stand-up

**Teacher:**
Good morning, Fikret! What’s your update today? Are there any impediments blocking your work?

**You:**
Today, I’m working on refactoring legacy code to reduce technical debt. I’m currently waiting on feedback from the UX team, which is a dependency. This is causing a slight delay.

**Teacher:**
Who is the impediment owner for that? Have you discussed it with them?

**You:**
Yes, Sarah is the impediment owner. I escalated the issue to her last week and we have a meeting planned to resolve it.

**Teacher:**
Sounds good. How does this affect our sprint goal?

**You:**
It might slow us down a bit, but we are still on track to meet the goal because other tasks are progressing well.

### Part B: Sprint Retrospective

Let’s reflect on the last sprint. What went well and what should we improve?

**You:**
The team collaborated well and the velocity trend improved. However, technical debt slowed down development in some areas. We should prioritize addressing this in the next sprint.
